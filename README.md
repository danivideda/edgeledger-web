# edgeledger
A fictional website for my private course

This website is created without using any framework.
So basically it's made with HTML5 and CSS3 from scratch, and a little JavaScript code to handle the smooth scrolling and the implementation of Google Maps APIs.

### Result:
https://danivideda.github.io/edgeledger-web/
